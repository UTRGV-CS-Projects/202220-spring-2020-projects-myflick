# MyFlick

## General

A fullstack React Native mobile application to help match those that don’t want to go the movies alone with another person of similar interests.

### Description

Once a user signs up or logs in, they can swipe on other users and movies to add them to their favorites. A user's favorites display on their profile so others can view—as well as their interests, photos, bio, age, name, city, etc. Users can message other users to start a conversation.
